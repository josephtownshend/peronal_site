      <description>That it will never come again
Is what makes life so sweet.
Believing what we don’t believe
Does not exhilarate.
That if it be, it be at best
An ablative estate &amp;ndash;
This instigates an appetite
Precisely opposite.</description>

      <description>I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,</description>

      <description>During week 6 of Makers Academy, students have the opportunity to sign up to become a mentor for new students working on the remote 4 week pre-course. The rough idea is to help guide the mentees through their first few nerve-racking weeks, impart some personal learning, maybe work on a kata together and just generally answer questions about the looming 12 week bootcamp.
The pre-course is different for everyone, some breeze through, others find it deeply troublesome - though it is generally accepted to be fairly challenging.</description>
